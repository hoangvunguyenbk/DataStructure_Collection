 /*
 *Tree traversal algorithms can be classified into two categoris
 1. Depth First Search DFS
 2. Breadth First Search BFS


 DFS: Can be further classified into three categories:
    * Preorder Travesal (current-left-right)
    * Inorder Travesal (left-current-right)
    * PostOrder Traversal (left-right-currrent)
 BFS: 
    * Level order travesal
